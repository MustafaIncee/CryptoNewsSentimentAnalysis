## 📝 Project Details

### 🎯 Project Goals
Our project aims to analyze cryptocurrency market sentiment through news articles using state-of-the-art transformer models. We focus on:
- Accurate sentiment classification of crypto news
- Multilingual analysis (Turkish-English translations)
- Comparison of different transformer models' performance
- Creating a robust sentiment analysis pipeline

### 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
   - Gathered cryptocurrency news articles
   - Cleaned and preprocessed text data
   - Translated Turkish news to English
   - Created balanced datasets for training

2. **Model Implementation**
   - Implemented 6 different transformer models:
     * BERT: Base model for comparison
     * ALBERT: Lightweight alternative
     * DeBERTA: Enhanced attention mechanism
     * DistilBERT: Faster, compressed version
     * FinBERT: Specialized for financial text
     * GPT: Generative approach to sentiment

3. **Analysis Process**
   - Each model was trained on the prepared dataset
   - Performed sentiment classification (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
   - Evaluated model performance using:
     * Accuracy
     * Precision
     * Recall
     * F1 Score
